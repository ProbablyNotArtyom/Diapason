# Diapason
FPGA core that implements a VGA controller with an external framebuffer. 
This repository includes the quartus project files needed to build the thing for its intended hardware.
Also in here is a verilator test bench used to simulate a VGA monitor attached to the controller.
It is built and ran using the makefile in the project root
